    "description": "Reminiscent of school traybakes with pink icing, these raspberry and custard muffins are given a suitably chic update – simply by turning cupcakes upside down. Adding custard to the cake batter creates a moist crumb and another layer of nostalgia, that pairs brilliantly with the raspberry in the jam icing.",
    "ingredients": [
      "140g unsalted butter, melted",
      "3 medium free-range eggs",
      "125g custard",
      "1 tsp vanilla bean paste",
      "180g golden caster sugar",
      "180g self-raising flour",
      "4 tbsp seedless raspberry jam",
      "100g icing sugar",
      "Sprinkles to decorate",
      "12-hole muffin tin"
    ],
    "method": [
      {
        "Step 1": "Heat the oven to 170°C fan/gas 5. Brush around 20g of the melted butter into each hole of the muffin tin, ensuring some gets into every corner. Pop it in the fridge while you make the cake batter."
      },
      {
        "Step 2": "In a large bowl, use a wooden spoon to mix the remaining 120g melted butter with the eggs, custard, vanilla and sugar until completely combined. Fold in the flour and a pinch of fine sea salt. Divide between the holes in the tin and bake for 14-18 minutes, until golden and springy to touch. Leave to cool in the tin for 5 minutes, then run a palette knife around the edge of each cake to release it. Transfer to a wire rack to cool completely. If the cakes have slight peaks on the base, remove these with a serrated knife once cool."
      },
      {
        "Step 3": "Heat the jam in a small saucepan then sift over the icing sugar and mix until combined. Add a little boiling water until you have a spoonable consistency. Drizzle the icing over each cake, allowing it to drip over the edges a little, then scatter with sprinkles before the icing sets."

      {
        "Step 1": "Heat the oven to 100°C fan/gas ½. To make the candied lemons, put the sugar and 30ml water in a small frying pan. Bring to the boil and allow to simmer for a minute or two, until syrupy. Add the lemon slices in one layer across the base of the pan. Simmer for 10 minutes, turning halfway, until tender, then lift onto a lined baking tray. Bake for 2 hours, turning halfway, to stiffen a little. Set aside to cool."
      },
      {
        "Step 2": "Increase the oven temperature to 180°C fan/gas 6. Grease and line a shallow 42cm x 30cm baking tray with butter and baking paper. Put the egg yolks, sugar and lemon juice in the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with a whisk attachment and whisk on a medium-high speed for about 3 minutes, until thick and pale. Sift in the flour and add a pinch of salt and the lemon zest. Gently fold together until just combined."
      },
      {
        "Step 3": "In a separate bowl, whisk the egg whites with clean beaters until they form stiff peaks. Mix a spoonful of the egg whites into the cake batter until combined, then gently fold in the rest. Scrape into the prepared baking tray and spread evenly to create a smooth, level top. Bake for 14-15 minutes, until golden and a skewer inserted comes out clean."
      },
      {
        "Step 4": "Put the tray on a wire rack to cool for 5 minutes, then dust the top lightly with icing sugar and cover with a sheet of baking paper topped with a clean tea towel. Carefully flip the tray over and remove both it and the baking paper. Use a serrated knife to trim the edges of the cake, trying to remove as little as possible, just to get them straight (these are a great cook’s snack). Starting from one of the shorter sides, carefully roll up the cake into a tight coil, then leave to cool completely (about 30 minutes)."
      },
      {
        "Step 5": "Meanwhile, make the buttercream. Put the blackberries in a blender with the lemon juice, whizz until smooth, then pass through a sieve and set aside. Put the egg whites and sugar in a large heatproof bowl (save on washing up by using the one from your mixer) and set over a pan of simmering water. Whisk the mixture lightly until the sugar has dissolved. To test, dip 2 fingers into the whites and rub together; if you can still feel grains of sugar, it needs a little more time."
      },
      {
        "Step 6": "Remove from the heat, add a pinch of salt and whisk with an electric mixer fitted with a whisk attachment on medium-high for 5-6 minutes until a thick, glossy meringue has formed and can hold peaks. Continue to whisk, adding the butter a piece at a time. Once it’s all added you should have a silky buttercream. Fold in 100ml of the whizzed blackberries."
      },
      {
        "Step 7": "Once the cake is cool, unroll it and cut the cake into three long strips, cutting parallel to the long side using a ruler and a serrated knife or pizza cutter. Use about half the buttercream to thinly coat the strips of sponge, spreading it evenly with a palette knife. Take one strip and, starting from the short side, start rolling it back up again, keeping it tight and evenly coiled. Line the seam up with the edge of the second strip and continue to roll it up to make a large cylinder of cake. Repeat with the third strip. This method ensures there are lots of neat, evenly spaced lines of buttercream throughout the sponge. Stand the cylinder up on a serving plate, then use the remaining buttercream to coat the sides and top of the cake and smooth evenly with a palette knife. Decorate with extra blackberries and the candied lemons."

Cool in the tins for 10 minutes, then turn out onto a wire rack and set aside to cool completely (see Make Ahead)."

Return the cake to the fridge for 1 hour, then spread with the remaining buttercream, giving it a smooth or swirled design as you prefer. Decorate with the candied lemon slices (see Know How)."

In another large bowl, beat the sugar with the butter using an electric mixer until light and glossy. Add the eggs, one at a time, beating after each addition, then add the vanilla.

Put one on top of each blob of dough in the tin, then press the remaining dough balls over the top, completely encasing the honey cube so it can’t escape from the pop cake when it melts. Put straight in the oven (or freeze – see make ahead) and bake for 25-30 minutes until the pop cakes are crisp and pale golden."

Stirring constantly with a fork or small whisk, pour in enough lemon juice to make a thick icing (you’ll need less juice than you think). Dip the pop cakes into the icing so the tops are evenly covered, then hold upside-down for a few seconds to allow the excess to drip off. Scatter with popping candy and sugar strands (if using), leave for 20 minutes to set the icing, then serve."

    "ingredients": [
      "1 3/4 cups confectioners' sugar",
      "1 cup almond flour",
      "3 large egg whites, at room temperature",
      "1/4 teaspoon cream of tartar",
      "Pinch of salt",
      "1/4 cup superfine sugar",
      "2 to 3 drops gel food coloring (Optional)",
      "1/2 teaspoon vanilla, almond or mint extract"
    ],
    "method": [
      {
        "Step 1": "Preheat the oven to 320 degrees F. Line 3 baking sheets with silicone mats or parchment. Measure the confectioners' sugar and almond flour by spooning them into measuring cups and leveling with a knife. Transfer to a bowl; whisk to combine"
      },
      {
        "Step 2": "Sift the sugar-almond flour mixture, a little at a time, through a fine-mesh sieve into a large bowl, pressing with a rubber spatula to pass through as much as possible. It will take a while, and up to 2 tablespoons of coarse almond flour may be left; save for another use."
      },
      {
        "Step 3": "Beat the egg whites, cream of tartar and salt with a mixer on medium speed until frothy. Increase the speed to medium high; gradually add the superfine sugar and beat until stiff and shiny, about 5 more minutes."

      {

      },
      {
        "Step 5": "Add the desired food coloring and extract (see below). Continue folding and turning, scraping down the bowl, until the batter is smooth and falls off the spatula in a thin flat ribbon, 2 to 3 minutes."
      },
      {
        "Step 6": "Transfer the batter to a pastry bag fitted with a 1/4-inch round tip. Holding the bag vertically and close to the baking sheet, pipe 1 1/4-inch circles (24 per sheet). Firmly tap the baking sheets twice against the counter to release any air bubbles."
      },
      {
        "Step 7": "Let the cookies sit at room temperature until the tops are no longer sticky to the touch, 15 minutes to 1 hour, depending on the humidity. Slip another baking sheet under the first batch (a double baking sheet protects the cookies from the heat)."
      },
      {
        "Step 8": "Bake the first batch until the cookies are shiny and rise 1/8 inch to form a 'foot,' 12 to 14 minutes. Transfer to a rack to cool completely. Repeat, using a double sheet for each batch. Peel the cookies off the mats and sandwich with a thin layer of filling"
      },

        "Step 9": "(Almond-Raspberry: Optional) Tint the batter with 2 drops neon pink gel food coloring; flavor with almond extract. For the filling, microwave 3 ounces chopped white chocolate, 2 tablespoons heavy cream and 1 tablespoon butter in 30-second intervals, stirring, until smooth. Stir in 1/4 teaspoon mint extract and 1 drop mint green gel food coloring."

      },
      {
        "Step 6": "Once chilled, preheat oven to 350°F (177°C). Line 2-3 large baking sheets with parchment paper or silicone baking mats. Carefully remove the top dough piece from the refrigerator. If it’s sticking to the bottom, run your hand under it to help remove it—see me do this in the video below. Using a cookie cutter, cut the dough into shapes. Re-roll the remaining dough and continue cutting until all is used. Repeat with 2nd piece of dough. (Note: It doesn’t seem like a lot of dough, but you get a lot of cookies from the dough scraps you re-roll.)"
      },
      {
        "Step 7": "Arrange cookies on baking sheets 3 inches apart. Bake for 11-12 minutes or until lightly browned around the edges. If your oven has hot spots, rotate the baking sheet halfway through bake time. Allow cookies to cool on the baking sheet for 5 minutes then transfer to a wire rack to cool completely before decorating."
      },
      {
        "Step 8": "Decorate the cooled cookies with royal icing or easy cookie icing. Feel free to tint either icing with gel food coloring. See post above for recommended decorating tools. No need to cover the decorated cookies as you wait for the icing to set. If it’s helpful, decorate the cookies directly on a baking sheet so you can stick the entire baking sheet in the refrigerator to help speed up the icing setting."
      },
      {
        "Step 9": "Enjoy cookies right away or wait until the icing sets to serve them. Once the icing has set, these cookies are great for gifting or for sending. Plain or decorated cookies stay soft for about 5 days when covered tightly at room temperature. For longer storage, cover and refrigerate for up to 10 days."

You can also store the cookies with the caramel in them in the fridge and the apples separately and then reheat individually before serving. Cookie cups should be stored in an air-tight container at room temperature for up to 24 hours or in the fridge for 4-5 days."
